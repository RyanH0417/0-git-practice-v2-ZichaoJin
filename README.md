# What is Software Development?

I recently read this fascinating article from IBM:  
[**What is software 
development?**](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/software-development)  

Published on **25 November 2024**, it covers the various stages and 
approaches of software development, including modern practices like 
DevOps, agile methodologies, and the increasing role of AI-powered tools 
in generating and testing code.

## Why It Interests Me

In particular, I found it interesting to see how artificial intelligence 
(AI) is becoming more integrated into every step of the development 
lifecycleâ€”from generating code snippets to automatically testing and 
deploying new features. Tools powered by generative AI can save time and 
reduce errors by generating code snippets, making autocomplete 
suggestions, and even translating legacy code into modern languages. 
Artificial intelligence can also enhance testing by automating processes 
to detect errors and bugs faster than manual testing, ensuring higher code 
quality. Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing software development 
as a powerful assistant to human developers.

## Comments from Jackson Chen

I found the article's coverage of DevOps particularly enlightening. The emphasis on combining development and operations through automation shows how modern software development has evolved beyond just writing code to embrace the full lifecycle of planning, deployment, and maintenance.
